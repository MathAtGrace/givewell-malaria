# Preface {.unnumbered}

This project is my attempt to redo some of [GiveWell's calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WqNL0PEA4cT470ALp0nItEEU8gM_IlhVNIJK1GqnFVE/edit?usp=sharing) using the format of a Quarto book, and mostly using the programming language `R` instead of their method of Google spreadsheets and separate webpages.

This work is currently very incomplete, but I did notice two small (and ultimately insignificant) errors in two of their spreadsheets.
