This project is my attempt to redo some of [GiveWell's calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WqNL0PEA4cT470ALp0nItEEU8gM_IlhVNIJK1GqnFVE/edit?usp=sharing) using the format of an Quarto book, and mostly using the programming language `R` instead of their method of Google spreadsheets and separate webpages.

This work is currently very incomplete.
