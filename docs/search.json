    "text": "5.1 Nigeria post-cycle coverage, total, weighted by target population (added by GiveWell)\nThe calculation from this sheet relies on target populations from Table 8 from Malaria Consortium, 2021 SMC coverage report, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mozambique, Nigeria, Togo, and Uganda. We only need the target populations for children 5 and under, so we choose that subset of the table.\nThis is using the target population from Nasarawa[2] row.\nIf we changed this to the 952,480 target population, which was the original estimate, then the total target population for Nigeria would match that reported in Table 1, Pg. 11 (8,399,151): 8,041,804 + (952,480 - 595,133) = 8,399,151\nWe are using the updated figure, because it is more accurate. Below, we change the name of Nasarawa2 -&gt; Nasarawa. In the join operation later, the old numbers corresponding to Nasawawa1 will be dropped.\nCalculations\nt_8 = read_excel(\"sources/2021/malaria-consortium-2021-table-08.xlsx\", \n                 sheet = \"Sheet1\", col_names = FALSE, \n                 skip = 3, n_max = 28) |&gt;\n  select(1:4) |&gt;\n  rename(country = 1, state = 2, age_group = 3, target_pop = 4) |&gt;\n  mutate(country = na.locf(country),\n         state = na.locf(state)) |&gt;\n  filter(age_group == '3–59 months') |&gt;\n  select(-age_group) |&gt;\n  mutate(state = case_when(state == 'Nasarawa2' ~ 'Nasarawa',\n                           TRUE ~ state)) |&gt;\n  suppressMessages()\nWe then join the target population numbers to our data from tables 15 and 16.
